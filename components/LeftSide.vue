    - allergen info needs to go somewhere
    <br />
    - recent orders
    <br />
    - tracker
    <br />
    - refresh on update
    <br />
    - theme color
    <br />
    - start working on drilling down pages
    <br />
    - this side is going to be recent orders, ads, tracker? news?
    <br />
    - i kinda wanna split this up.. into like food and drinks maybe or dinner,
    breakfast, lunch, drinks, sides, dessert
    <br />
    - i need to get a full menu written up
    <br />
    - uhhh
    <br />
    - i think i like this layout, but i might make it more like door dash, like
    instead of entrees - sides ++ i'll do like sandwiches -> view all pizza ->
    view all smoothies -> view all etc
    <br />
    - ^ so in order to do that, i need to have a menu fully fleshed out
    <br />
    - make buttons more consistent?
    <br />
    - i need some way to display locations? or have some feed back based on
    locations
    <br />
    - this should be a layout
  </div>
